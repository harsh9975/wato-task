# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Instructions to run the project
First install the necessary dependies required for the project.

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn 
```
## Step 2: Setting up Android and iOS
### For Android add local.properties file

```bash
# Create a local.properties file in `android` folder
sdk.dir = /Users/{userName}/Library/Android/sdk
```

### For iOS first we have to install pods

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
